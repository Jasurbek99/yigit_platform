# Shipment Sheet

Excel-style spreadsheet view at `/export/shipments/sheet/`. Each shipment is **one column**; each operational field is **one row**. Mirrors the original Excel "Eksport Hasabat" tab the platform replaced.

Backend: `ShipmentViewSet.sheet()` action at `GET /api/v1/export/shipments/sheet/` returns a flat per-season payload (no pagination — the grid loads the whole season).

```

Three frozen left columns (#, Who, Field label) + virtualised data columns rendered via `@tanstack/react-virtual`. A full season (~1,000 shipments × 44 rows) is handled by virtualising columns; only ~20 visible at a time are in the DOM.

## Freeze panes (configurable)

Both axes of the freeze are user-configurable, modelled on Google Sheets:

- **Frozen rows** — top N data rows (default `13`, mirroring the original "rows 2–14 = identity & planning" band). Rendered in a `position: sticky; top: ROW_HEIGHT` band; remaining rows scroll vertically beneath it.
- **Frozen columns** — first N data columns (default `0`). Rendered as `position: sticky; left: <offset>` cells between the label band and the virtualizer container; the remaining shipments are passed to `@tanstack/react-virtual` as the virtualization population.

State lives in `sheetStore` (`frozenRowCount`, `frozenColCount`) and persists to `localStorage` under `ygt-sheet-freeze`. Defaults restore on first visit. The grid clamps stored values against the visible row/column counts each render so a stale localStorage value (e.g. 5C frozen, only 2 shipments visible after filter) still produces a coherent layout.

### Settings modal

The toolbar's **⚙ Settings** button (top-left, after the Gapy switch) opens a `Sheet Display Settings` modal that houses the freeze pickers:

- **Freeze rows up to:** Ant `Select` with one option per visible row in the current order — labelled `<field label> (R<row_number>)` (e.g. `Harvest Status (R14)`). Picking row at position N sets `frozenRowCount = N`. The list reflects the user's reordered + visible row sequence (not the original Excel numbering), so freezing matches what the user actually sees on screen.
- **Freeze columns up to:** Ant `Select` with options `After column 1`, `After column 2`, …, capped at `min(20, shipmentCount − 1)`. Picking N sets `frozenColCount = N`. Disabled when there are fewer than 2 shipments.

Both pickers apply changes live (no Save button); the modal has `Reset to default` (rows=13, cols=0) and `Done` (close). A small badge dot on the gear button indicates the freeze is non-default. There is no longer an "Up to current row/column" shortcut — picking the row/column directly from the modal is more discoverable and doesn't require the user to first click a cell.

A blue 2px line on the trailing edge of the last frozen row/column marks the freeze line, mirroring Excel/Sheets. Header label cells (`#`, Who, Field name) are also `position: sticky; left: 0` so they remain visible during horizontal scrolling. Rows and section containers carry `min-width: max-content` so the sticky-left cells are bounded by the row's full content width — without this they unstick once the user scrolls past one viewport-width.

## Row config

**Backend is the single source of truth.** `backend/apps/export/sheet_rows.py` exports `DEFAULT_SHEET_ROWS` (42 entries — row 16 is intentionally absent, matching the original Excel layout). The `/api/v1/export/shipments/sheet/` response ships these as the `rows` top-level key alongside `results` / `comment_counts` / `task_counts`. Frontend renders whatever the API returns; there is no longer a hard-coded `SHEET_ROW_CONFIG` array on the frontend. Adding, removing, or reordering rows is a one-place change in `sheet_rows.py`.

Translation strings (`sheet.who.*`, `sheet.row.*`) stay in `frontend/src/i18n/{tk,ru,en}.json`; the API ships only the i18n keys (`default_who_key`, `label_key`).

Dropdown rows whose `options_source` is fixed (e.g. `vehicle_condition`) resolve via `frontend/src/constants/sheetOptions.ts` `SHEET_OPTIONS_REGISTRY`. Dynamic dropdowns (`country`, `customer`, `border_point`, etc.) keep using their dedicated TanStack Query hooks.

### Per-user row order and visibility (Phase 2a — ADR-0003/ADR-0008)

Users can reorder and hide sheet rows through the toolbar. Preferences are stored server-side in the `UserSheetRowPref` table (one row per `(user, SheetRowSetting)`) and synced debounced from the frontend.

**Model**: `export_user_sheet_row_pref` — flat child table (no JSONField, MSSQL-safe per ADR-0008).
- `position`: sparse integer (step 1024). NULL = inherit admin `display_order`.
- `is_hidden`: true = hidden from this user's view. AND-composed with admin `is_visible`.

**Row order resolution** (in `/sheet/` action):
1. Load all `UserSheetRowPref` for the request user (1 query).
2. For each row in `DEFAULT_SHEET_ROWS`:
   - Skip if admin `is_visible=False` (admin-hidden; hard override).
   - Skip if user `is_hidden=True` (user-hidden).
   - `effective_order = user.position ?? setting.display_order` (fallback 999999 if no DB config).
3. Sort by `effective_order` (stable).

**`user_preferences` key** in `/sheet/` response:
```json
{
  "user_preferences": {
    "row_order": [12, 5, 8, ...],   // ids where user.position IS NOT NULL, ordered ASC
    "hidden_rows": [3, 14, ...]     // ids where user.is_hidden=True
  }
}
```
Frontend uses `user_preferences` to initialise the drag-and-drop row order state without a separate API call.

**Sync endpoint**: `GET/PATCH /api/v1/export/user/sheet-preferences/` — `UserSheetPreferencesView`. Auth: `IsAuthenticated`. PATCH accepts `{ row_order?: [...], hidden_rows?: [...] }` — absent key = no-op. Both keys are idempotent: the payload fully replaces the dimension it targets. The `row_order` key lists only ids with user-set positions; unlisted rows fall back to admin `display_order`.

### Per-row trigger configuration (Sheet Control v2)

Each row can be assigned **one or more formal roles** AND/OR **a specific user** and **extra users**, configurable in **Shipment Settings → Sheet Rows** (admin-only). The config is stored across three tables:

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `export_sheet_row_setting` | One row per `field_key`. Holds labels, description, style, `is_locked`, soft-delete fields, optimistic `version`. |
| `export_sheet_row_role_trigger` | Child rows: one per `(setting, role)`. Replaces the old single `triggered_role` column. |
| `export_sheet_row_user_permission` | Child rows: one per `(setting, user)`. Extra users who can edit regardless of `is_locked`. Soft-deleted with `deleted_at`. |

**Trigger + Lock semantics (ADR-0008 / ADR-0009 / ADR-0010):**
- If `is_locked=False` (default): `triggered_roles[]` acts as the "Who" label. Editing falls back to `RoleFieldPermission` for all roles — the trigger is display-only.
- If `is_locked=True`: only users whose role is in `triggered_roles[]` **OR** who appear in `extra_user_ids[]` (non-deleted `SheetRowUserPermission`) can edit the cell. All other roles get the fallback "no setting → field-perm" path denied.
- If both `triggered_roles[]` and `triggered_user` are empty (`is_locked=False`), only `RoleFieldPermission` governs access.
- `admin`, `director`, and `is_superuser` always bypass the lock.

**"Who" column label:**
1. `triggered_user.username` if a specific user is set (warning chip if `is_active=False`).
2. First matched `triggered_roles[]` label (role display name) if any roles are configured.
3. Fallback: translate `default_who_key` from i18n.

**Edit-map**: `get_sheet_edit_map(user)` computes edit access in **4 DB queries** (1 settings + 2 prefetch for `role_triggers` and `user_permissions` + 1 field perms). Result is embedded in the `/sheet/` response as `row_settings[field_key]` — the frontend never makes per-cell permission calls.

**Admin endpoint**: `GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE /api/v1/export/admin/sheet-rows/{id}/` — see the Sheet Rows Admin section below.

**Visibility toggle**: `is_visible=False` rows are excluded entirely from the `row_settings` map in the `/sheet/` response. Hidden rows are always denied edit access.

### Sheet Rows Admin endpoint

`/api/v1/export/admin/sheet-rows/` — managed by `SheetRowSettingViewSet`. Auth: `admin` role only.

| Method | Path | Action |
|--------|------|--------|
| GET | `/sheet-rows/` | List all rows (`?include_deleted=1` shows soft-deleted) |
| GET | `/sheet-rows/{id}/` | Row detail with `role_triggers[]` and `user_permissions[]` |
| POST | `/sheet-rows/` | Create a new setting |
| PATCH | `/sheet-rows/{id}/` | Update labels, `is_locked`, `triggered_user`, `triggered_roles[]`, style. Requires matching `version` (optimistic lock) — wrong version → 409 Conflict. |
| DELETE | `/sheet-rows/{id}/` | Soft-delete (sets `deleted_at`). Rejected with 400 if row is still `is_visible=True`. |
| POST | `/sheet-rows/{id}/restore/` | Restore a soft-deleted row. Returns 400 if already active. |
| POST | `/sheet-rows/reorder/` | Accepts `[{"id": N, "display_order": N}]`. Uses sparse ADR-0007 spacing (`(idx+1)*1024`). Writes one `AuditLog` row for every order change. |
| POST | `/sheet-rows/{id}/permissions/bulk/` | Bulk grant/revoke `SheetRowUserPermission`. Body: `{"grant": [uid, ...], "revoke": [uid, ...]}`. Idempotent. |

**Optimistic locking (ADR-0006):** Every PATCH must include `version` matching the current DB value. The server increments `version` on save. Concurrent edits are detected and return 409 with `{"error": "Version conflict. Reload and retry.", "current_version": N}`.

**Soft-delete (ADR-0002):** `DELETE` sets `deleted_at` + `deleted_by`. Soft-deleted rows are excluded from the default `get_queryset()` (manager `.active()`). Use `?include_deleted=1` to see them. Restore via `/restore/`.

**Sparse display_order (ADR-0007):** Rows use step=1024 spacing (1024, 2048, …). Reorder recalculates from scratch. Inserting between two rows uses midpoint; no rebalancing needed until values collapse.

| Section | Rows | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| Frozen top | 2–14 | Identity & planning — route note, customs/docs/harvest status, cargo code, blocks, firms, country, customer, city, import firm |
| Scrollable bottom | 15–44 | Operations & logistics — truck capacity, loading/departure timestamps, transport, border, weights, variety, sale window, sales report flag |

Row numbers mirror the original "Eksport Hasabat" Excel sheet so users can cross-reference the platform view with their spreadsheet by row index. Earlier versions of the platform had a one-row offset on R20+ (loading_started_at was rendered on R20 instead of R19, transit_days_temp on R27 instead of R26, etc.); that has been corrected.

**Per-role freeform notes (R17, R18):** Plain text cells, parallel to Gadam's `export_manager_note` (R5). R17 holds `warehouse_note` — owned by Soltanmyrat (`loading_dept_head`); deputies (`warehouse_chief`) share the same field. R18 holds `document_note` — owned by Şirin (`document_team`). Editable inline like any other text cell; per-cell discussion threads still live on each cell's CommentMarker.

## Comments Drawer

The Sheet has a right-side **Comments Drawer** (Ant `Drawer`, `mask=false`, 360px) for cell-anchored discussions and task assignment. Full process documented in [[../processes/comments-tasks]] — short summary here:

- **Open**: Comments button in the toolbar, OR click any cell's blue/orange/green marker badge
- **Filters** (chip group in drawer header): _This cell_ (when a cell is active), _All cells_, _My tasks_
- **Compose**:
  - Type `@` → user/role autocomplete popover (`useMentionable`)
  - Type `#` → cell autocomplete popover (from the `rows` payload of `/sheet/`)
  - Toggle "Pin to active cell" — sets `field_key` so the comment becomes a cell anchor
  - Pick an Assignee → comment becomes a task; assignee gets `task_assigned` notification
  - Ctrl+Enter to send
- **Markers** appear in cell corners when a cell has comments: blue (comment), orange (open task), green (done)
- **Deep-link**: `/export/shipments/sheet?shipment={id}&row={fieldKey}&comment={id}` selects the cell, auto-opens the drawer, and scrolls the comment into view with a 2-second highlight ring. Used by all three new notification kinds (`mention`, `task_assigned`, `task_done`).

The sheet endpoint response now includes top-level `comment_counts` and `task_counts` dicts keyed by shipment ID — used by the cell markers and the toolbar's "my open tasks" badge respectively.

## Cell-level edit audit (clock-icon marker)

Every shipment field PATCH writes one `AuditLog` row per changed field with structured `(field_name, old_value, new_value, user, timestamp)` (`backend/apps/export/services/sheet_audit.py` `render_field_value()` is the single rendering source — `__str__` for FK objects, `format(d, 'f')` for Decimals, `.isoformat()` for date/datetime, `.label` for TextChoices). Same-value PATCHes write zero rows. The save and the audit `bulk_create` run inside one `transaction.atomic()` so a save failure rolls back audit rows too. Existing 403/400 forbidden-field path on `partial_update` is preserved.

The `/sheet/` response includes a sparse `last_edits[shipment_id_str][field_key] = {user_id, user_name, old_value, new_value, edited_at}` map — populated by a single window-function query (`Window(RowNumber(), partition_by=[object_id, field_name], order_by=created_at DESC)`, filtered to `rn=1` via `Subquery(values('pk'))` so it stays MSSQL-safe and bounded to the visible shipments). Cells with a matching entry render a small clock-icon marker (`CellLastEditMarker`, harmonised with `CommentMarker`):

- **Hover** → tooltip `"Last edited by {user} on {date} — {old} → {new}"`
- **Click** → Ant `Popover` lazily fetches `GET /api/v1/export/shipments/{id}/field-history/?field=<field_key>&limit=50` (paginated, newest-first) and renders the prior edits. Endpoint requires `can_edit_sheet_field(user, field_key)` — readers without edit access see the latest summary on hover but get 403 + `t('sheet.history_forbidden')` on click (privacy: historical values may include old prices, phones).

Defaults: `?limit` defaults to 50, capped at 200. The popover does no pagination of its own — limit-based truncation only.

**Known limitation:** fields modified by `save()` side effects (computed totals, auto status transitions) are NOT captured by this hook — only fields the user actually submitted in the PATCH body. Status transitions already emit their own `AuditLog` rows from `services_workflow.py`. Other side-effect fields would need their own service-level hooks.

R24 = `has_doc_advance` (✓/❌, Babageldi). True once a `FinansistAdvanceShipment` row links the shipment to a `FinansistAdvance` — i.e. the finansist has issued documentation/customs money for the shipment. Click navigates to `/export/advances?shipment={id}`. R25 = `customs_exit_at` (Türkmenistan customs exit, Şirin). R26 = `transit_days_temp` (transit days + temperature, Quality inspector).

## Input types

| `inputType` | Editor | Notes |
|-------------|--------|-------|
| `text` | Ant `Input` | Strings; saves on Enter or blur |
| `number` | Ant `InputNumber` | Decimals for kg, USD |
| `phone` | Ant `Input` | Driver phone — same as text, semantic only |
| `date` | Ant `DatePicker` | ISO date (YYYY-MM-DD) |
| `datetime` | Ant `DatePicker showTime` | ISO 8601 with offset |
| `dropdown` | Ant `Select` | Options from reference hooks (countries, firms, …) or `ShipmentOptionType` by category |
| `multiselect` | Ant `Select mode="multiple"` | Junction tables (`firm_splits`, `block_sources`) — posts to `block-sources/` / `firm-splits/` action endpoints |
| `status` | Ant `Select` | Options from `ShipmentOptionType` filtered by `category = fieldKey` |
| `readonly` | None | Display-only; never editable |
| `comment_count` | None | Display count + icon; click navigates to ShipmentDetail's Changes tab |

## Permissions

The sheet now reads from the **dynamic permission registry** (no hardcoded role matrix):

- Direct shipment fields → `canEditField(user, 'shipment', fieldKey)` — gated by `RoleFieldPermission`
- Junction tables → `canDo(user, 'shipment_firm_split' | 'shipment_block_source', 'edit')`
- Add-column button → `canDo(user, 'shipment', 'create')`

Directors manage these matrices at `/admin/permissions`. The seed defaults are populated by `seed_permissions`.

> **AD-1 timestamps** (`loading_started_at`, `customs_entry_at`, `customs_exit_at`, `departed_at`, `border_crossed_at`, `arrived_at`, `sale_started_at`, `sale_ended_at`) are **not** in `RESOURCE_FIELDS['shipment']` and are explicitly excluded from `_ALL_PATCHABLE_FIELDS` in `ShipmentPatchSerializer`. They render as non-editable in the sheet — set them via `transition_to()` (see [[../processes/shipment-lifecycle]]).

## Save flow

`useShipmentPatch.ts` performs **optimistic updates with rollback**:

```
edit cell → setQueryData(... new value) → PATCH /export/shipments/{id}/ →
  ✓ success: invalidate ['shipments', 'sheet']
  ✗ error:   restore previous cache, show toast 'sheet.save_error'
```

Junction edits use a separate mutation that POSTs to `block-sources/` or `firm-splits/` and invalidates the same query key.

### Auto-split for R8 / R9 (Gap 7 — see ADR-016)

When the user picks blocks (R8) or firms (R9) in the multiselect, the frontend sends only the IDs — **`weight_kg` is omitted**. The backend fills the weights using two different rules because the two cells track conceptually different numbers:

| Cell | Rule |
|---|---|
| **R8 `block_sources`** (Soltanmyrat) | `(shipment.weight_net or 18,100) / N`, last entry gets the rounding remainder. Real harvest weight, no cap. |
| **R9 `firm_splits`** (Şulgun) | Lookup by N in `TruckSplitDefault` (admin-configurable). Defaults: 1→18,100 · 2→9,000 · 3→6,000. The OFFICIAL kg written on export documents — capped at 18,100 kg total per truck even though real trucks carry 20,000–21,000 kg. |

Director changes the per-firm-count amounts at `/admin/shipment-settings` → "Truck Split Defaults" tab. Cache invalidates on save so the next firm-split save uses the new value.

If the client sends an explicit non-zero `weight_kg`, the backend honours it (admin override path).

## Per-shipment column color

Each shipment column header carries a small swatch button (top-right of the cell) that opens an Ant `ColorPicker`. The picked hex (`#RRGGBB`) is stored on `Shipment.column_color` (nullable `CharField(max_length=7)`); clearing the picker writes `null`. Sheet cells in that column then render with a tinted background (`color-mix(in srgb, var(--col-tint) 60%, var(--surface))`), and the header gets a 3px top border in the raw color so the flag is visible from the column-header row alone. For gapy-satys shipments the tint is mixed 75/25 over the gapy pink with `!important` so the operator's pick wins (white reads as white instead of disappearing into pink).

Permission: gated by `canEditField(user, 'shipment', 'column_color')`. Only roles with the `'*'` shipment field grant (currently `admin`, `export_manager`, `director`) and `is_superuser` see the swatch — other roles still see the tint but cannot change it. The field is in `RESOURCE_FIELDS['shipment']` so it surfaces in the admin permission-matrix UI; the existing wildcard `RoleFieldPermission` rows mean no seed migration is required.

The picker has `disabledAlpha` to suppress the opacity slider, and the frontend defensively truncates the hex to 7 chars before saving so an older Ant build emitting `#RRGGBBAA` still fits the `max_length=7` column. Save flow reuses `useShipmentPatch` (optimistic update + rollback). Every change writes one `AuditLog` row (`field_name='column_color'`) via the existing sheet-PATCH audit hook; the field is intentionally **not** in `DEFAULT_SHEET_ROWS`, so no clock-icon marker appears on any cell. The colour ships through `ShipmentSheetSerializer` as the `column_color` field.

## Toolbar

- `+ Add column` — creates a new draft shipment (`useSheetCreate`); visible when `canDo('shipment', 'create')`
- Search — filters by `cargo_code` or `customer_name` (client-side)
- Gapy only — filters to `is_gapy_satys = true`
- **⚙ Settings** — opens the `Sheet Display Settings` modal with the freeze pickers (see Freeze panes above)
- Deadline timer — global hour deadline indicator

## Backend payload

`ShipmentSheetSerializer` flattens 44+ fields including:
- `firm_splits` and `block_sources` (inline `SheetFirmSplitInlineSerializer` / `SheetBlockSourceInlineSerializer`)
- Quality doc booleans (`doc_azyk`, `doc_suriji`, `doc_hil`, `doc_kalibrowka`) — sourced from `quality.*` (related_name on `QualityDocument` is `quality`)
- `has_sales_report` — annotated by viewset queryset via `Exists(SalesReport.objects.filter(shipment=OuterRef('pk')))`
- `variety_code` from `TomatoVariety.code` (the official 01–10/E1–E3 registry code)
- AD-1 timestamps — read-only display
- AD-2 fields — `vehicle_condition`, `vehicle_condition_note`, `route_note`

Querystring `?season=<id>` overrides the active season; default scopes to `season__is_active=True`.

### `/sheet/` response top-level keys (v2)

```json

  "results":          [ /* IShipmentSheetItem[] */ ],
  "comment_counts":   { "<shipment_id>": { "<field_key>": 3, "__shipment__": 1 } },

  },
  "last_edits":       { "<shipment_id>": { "<field_key>": { "user_id": 3, "user_name": "...", "old_value": "...", "new_value": "...", "edited_at": "..." } } },

    "hidden_rows": [3, 14]       // ids where user.is_hidden = True
  }
}
```

**`users_index`** is a compact lookup map (`str(user_id) → {name, role}`) emitted once at root to avoid per-row user object repetition. Frontend uses it to resolve `triggered_user` and `extra_user_ids` without additional API calls.

**`current_user_lang`** is the request user's preferred language (defaults to `'tk'`). Frontend uses it to pick the right `labels[lang]` for the "Who" column and cell tooltips.

## Known issues

- All rows from R2 to R44 are now configured (R24 is the new finansist doc-advance flag).
- **`harvest_date`, `additional_notes_arap`, `truck_capacity`, `product_date`, `transit_days_temp`, `truck_plate`, `driver_name`, `driver_phone`** — present in `sheetRowConfig.ts` but not in the `Shipment` model nor `_ALL_PATCHABLE_FIELDS`. They render but cell edits will 403 from the backend. Either map to the right model fields (e.g. `truck_plate` → `truck_head_id` lookup) or remove from the row config.
